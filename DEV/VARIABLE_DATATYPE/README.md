## Variables

In Java, variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated by the program. Here are some key points about variables:

- **Declaration**: A variable must be declared before it is used. The declaration specifies the type of the variable and its name.

  ```java
  int age;
  double salary;
  String name;
  ```

- **Initialization**: A variable can be initialized with a value at the time of declaration or later in the program.

```java
int age = 25;
double salary = 50000.50;
String name = "John Doe";
```

- **Scope**: The scope of a variable determines where it can be accessed. Variables can be local (inside a method or block) or instance/class variables (within a class).

- **Naming Conventions**: Variable names should be descriptive and follow the camelCase convention (e.g., employeeId, totalAmount).

## Data Types

Java supports several types of data to store values. Data types are categorized into primitive and reference types:

- **Primitive Data Types**
  byte: An 8-bit integer.

```java
byte b = 100;
short: A 16-bit integer.
```

```java
short s = 10000;
int: A 32-bit integer.
```

```java
int i = 100000;
long: A 64-bit integer.
```

```java
long l = 10000000000L;
float: A single-precision 32-bit floating-point number.
```

```java
float f = 10.5f;
double: A double-precision 64-bit floating-point number.
```

```java
double d = 20.99;
char: A single 16-bit Unicode character.
```

```java
char c = 'A';
boolean: Represents true or false.
```

```java
boolean isJavaFun = true;
```
